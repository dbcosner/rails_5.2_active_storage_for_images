# Saving images using Active Storage in Rails 5.2

Part of the work I did in the process of building a blog component for my [personal home page](https://drewcosner.com). (Ongoing as of writing this README.)

I wanted to be able to upload any number of images to use in any given blog post. Active Storage is now the Rails Way.

I used the Rails Edge documentation, and the information here: https://phase2online.com/blog/2018/10/03/easily-upload-files-with-active-storage-in-rails-5-2/

Installation is as simple as:

```
rails active_storage:install
rails db:migrate
```

### The Model

``app/models/blog_post.rb``

As usual, Rails makes things simple:

```ruby
class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
  has_many_attached :images
end
```

### The Controller

``app/controllers/blog_posts_controller.rb``

To save the post, images and all, the only change I had to make to the file generated by the ``rails g scaffold`` command was to the strong parameters:

```ruby
def create
  @blog_post = BlogPost.new(blog_post_params)
  # ...
end
 ```

```ruby
def blog_post_params
  params.require(:blog_post).permit(:name, images: [])
end
```

``app/views/blog_posts/edit.html.erb``

When editing, I wanted to be able to use Ajax to remove images associated with the blog post without having to reload. I decided to put this logic in its own action:

```ruby
def destroy_image
  @image = @blog_post.images.find(params[:image_id])
  @image.destroy
  respond_to do |format|
    format.js
  end
end
```

``config/routes.rb``

```ruby
resources :blog_posts do
  member do
    delete :destroy_image
  end
end
```

### The Views

``app/views/blog_posts/_form.html.erb``

Again, Rails makes things simple. I just had to use the ``file_field`` tag. The only tricky thing was that, to allow multiple images to be uploaded at once, I had to specify ``multiple: true``.

Since this is my personal blog, I thought it was fine to leave it this way and just use ``ctrl`` or ``ctrl + shift`` to select multiple images for upload. In a user-facing form, I would implement this with JS and an "add another file" button.

```
<%= form_with(model: blog_post, local: true) do |form| %>

  <%# ... %>

  <%= form.label(:name) %><br />
  <%= form.text_field(:name) %>
  <%= form.label(:images, 'Add images to the post') %>
  <%= form.file_field(:images, multiple: true) %>

  <div class="actions">
    <%= form.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

``app/views/blog_posts/edit.html.erb``

I used an Ajax link and server-generated JS to remove images without having to reload the edit form:

```
<% @blog_post.images.each do |image| %>
  <div id="<%= "blog-post-id-#{@blog_post.id}-image-id-#{image.id}" %>">
    <p><%= image_tag(image) %></p>
    <p><%= link_to(
      "Delete image: #{image.filename}",
      destroy_image_blog_post_path(image_id: image.id),
      confirm: 'Delete image?',
      remote: true,
      method: :delete,
      )
    %></p>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

``app/views/blog_posts/destroy_image.js.erb``

```
document.getElementById('<%= "blog-post-id-#{@blog_post.id}-image-id-#{@image.id}" %>').remove();
```
